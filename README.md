# fvtt-l5r4ed-dice-roller
An implementation of a dice roller to Legends of the five rings 4th Edition game system for Foundry Virtual Tabletop (http://foundryvtt.com).

## Roll
It captures chat message and converts to a Foundry VTT roll pattern and shows the result with the Legend of Five Rings text roll.

Example: 10k6 is converted to '/r 10d10k6x10'
